I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UTN FRM. My current research focuses on prediction of frost location using machine learning and wireless sensor networks.

I have been lecturing Informatic and Internet of Things (Electronic Engineer Department), Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (Information System Department) as a teacher assistant in UTN, Mendoza. 

I'm founder and co-organizer of R-Ladies Mendoza chapter.
